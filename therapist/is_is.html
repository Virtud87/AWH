        <h2>You are not alone! I'm here for you!</h2>
        <p>
          As a Korean-born woman living in the United States for over the past
          twelve years, I know first hand at least some of the challenges and
          difficulties that international students or immigrants face daily; if
          we work together, I will extend both my professional expertise as well
          as some shared human experience.

        <h2>Language Barrier</h2>
        <p>
          Have you had a difficulty with communicating because of language
          barrier? Learning a new language is not easy. It takes time and
          practice. It is frustrating when people do not understand what you are
          saying because of your accent or difficulty with pronouncing certain
          English consonants or vowels. Also, there are some words in your
          mother tongue that do not have appropriate translations in English,
          and thus it is hard to convey what you really mean. Language barrier
          often causes misunderstanding. However, it has nothing to do with your
          actual intelligence or ability to grasp the concept behind what others
          say to you. Therefore, you do not have to feel inferior to native
          English speakers. You do not have to feel low self-esteem.
