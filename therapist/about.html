          <p>
            I am most passionate about empowering clients from diverse races,
            ethnicities, genders, sexualities, spiritualities, and
            socio-economic backgrounds. As a Korea-born immigrant, I am
            culturally sensitive and respectful of clients’ diverse backgrounds.
            I am also passionate about removing stigma attached to seeking
            counseling for one's mental health and well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a compassionate, intuitive, and dedicated therapist who
            genuinely and deeply cares about my clients. For me, thanks to my
            cultural heritage and spiritual practices, it is very natural to put
            myself in other’s shoes.
          </p>

            After earning my Masters degree in Transpersonal Counseling
            Psychology from Naropa University, I have worked at Mental Health
            Partners in Boulder and then took Doctoral courses in Clinical
            Psychology at Pacifica Graduate Institute in California.
