        <h2>Immigrants & International Students</h2>
        <p class="body__p">
          As an immigrant and former international student, I know first hand
          the difficulties associated with these circumstances. Do you find
          yourself being homesick? Are you having difficulty adjusting to a new
          country and culture? Are language barriers and misinterpretations
          interfering with your work or studies? I can help you navigate the
          challenges you are facing to find a path forward and overcome!

        <h2>Hi, My Name is Jieun!</h2>
        <p class="body__p">
          I am a compassionate, intuitive, and dedicated therapist who genuinely
          and deeply cares about my clients. Thanks to my cultural heritage and
          spiritual practices, it is very natural to put myself in otherâ€™s
          shoes. It is my top priority to co-create and maintain a safe space
          for clients to share their personal stories, thoughts, feelings, and
          vulnerabilities. I highly value building rapport and therapeutic
          relationships with my clients. I believe in clients' innate
          inner-strength, courage, perseverance, and ability to heal their
          suffering through guidance and to eventually live a life they want.
        </p>
        <p class="body__p">
          I earned my BA in French and French Literature at Ajou University in
          Suwon, Korea. After graduating, I furthered my studies abroad and
          earned my Master's at Naropa University in Boulder, CO. I am also an
          unlicensed psychotherapist and am certified in EMDR-II.
