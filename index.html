        <p>
          What's broken can be mended. What hurts can be healed. No matter how
          dark it gets, the sun is going to rise again. - The Buddah

          <h3>Treatment Foundation</h3>
          <p>
            It is my top priority to co-create and maintain a safe space for
            clients to share their personal stories, thoughts, feelings, and
            vulnerabilities. I highly value building rapport and therapeutic
            relationships with clients. I believe in clients' innate
            inner-strength, courage, perseverance, and abilities to heal their
            suffering through guidance and to thrive in living a life they want.

          <h3>Treatment Procedure</h3>
          <p>
            With my deep caring nature, I am passionate about helping clients
            transform their struggles or suffering into growth, wisdom, and
            healing. I listen to my clients carefully with the undivided
            attention and keen awareness from a non-judgmental stance. I ask
            questions with intent and curiosity. I offer reflections, modeling,
            experiential exercises, scientific research, and various mindfulness
            tools to increase awareness of themselves. These in turn help
            discover root causes of their pain and suffering, to gain insights,
            and to assist them in empowering themselves throughout their healing
            and growth journey.

          <h3>Treatment Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            I specialize in working with clients who have been suffering from
            addictions, substance abuse disorders, and co-occurring mental
            illnesses such as depression and anxiety due to various trauma and
            PTSD. From a holistic therapeutic stance, I value exploring the
            depths of the human mind and body in service of greater health and
            wholeness. I have experienced the importance of taking subconscious
            and unconscious materials into account in therapy for healing deep
            wounds, increasing profound insights of oneâ€™s whole being, and
            providing a platform for a greater sense of well-being.

          <h3>Trauma & PTSD</h3>
          <p>
            Many individuals can experience symptoms associated with painful and
            traumatic circumstances. Anxiety, fear, and hopelessness are a few
            emotions that can linger post traumatic events. We can work together
            to overcome these symptoms and guide you through the process of
            grief and healing.

            Depression, fear, and anxiety are some of the most common and
            uncomfortable emotions that we can experience at some point in our
            lives. Through counseling and treatment, I will help you recover
            motivation, perspective, and joy that you once had in your life.

          <h3>Relationships</h3>
          <p>
            Relationship counseling can be beneficial to couples who are looking
            to strengthen their emotional connection, in all stages of their
            relationship. Therapy sessions are held with both couples and is a
            supportive place to discuss issues and solutions to better
            strengthen your relationship.
